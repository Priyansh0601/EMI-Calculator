EMI stands for Equated Monthly Instalment for the loan you avail from your bank. The EMI consists of the principal portion of the loan amount and the interest. Therefore, EMI = principal amount + interest paid on the loan. The EMI, usually, remains fixed for the entire tenure of your loan, and it is to be repaid over the tenure of the loan on a monthly basis. Here are the five benefits of using the EMI calculator:
